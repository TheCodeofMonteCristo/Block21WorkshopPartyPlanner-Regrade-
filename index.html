<!-- Overall Pseudocode Explains the functionality of this HTML file:



 
HTML Structure:

The HTML document begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, defining the document as HTML5.
The <html lang="en"> tag specifies that the language is English, important for accessibility tools.
Head Section:

The meta charset="UTF-8" tag defines the character encoding for the page, supporting a broad range of symbols.
The meta name="viewport" tag ensures that the page is responsive, scaling correctly on various devices, particularly mobile.
The <title> sets the name of the page, visible in the browser's tab.
The linked external CSS file (styles.css) allows for styling the page, while the JavaScript file (index.js) is deferred, ensuring the script only runs after the HTML is fully loaded.
Body Section:

The header <h1>Parties!!</h1> introduces the purpose of the page.
The form <form id="addEvent"> contains input fields for adding new event details. These include:
Event Name: A text input field for the event name.
Event Date: A date input field allowing the user to choose a date.
Event Location: A text input field for the event location.
Event Description: A text input field for a brief description.
The form is concluded with a submit button (<button type="submit">Add Event</button>), allowing users to submit event details.
Dynamic Content:

The unordered list (<ul id="events"></ul>) is used to dynamically display the events added by the user. This will be manipulated via JavaScript.->
